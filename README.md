## About The Project

The goal of this project was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a README file pased on user input. Once initiated, the user is prompted to provide the followimg content:

* Project Title
* Project Description
* Installation Instructions
* Usage
* Build Tools & Technologies
* Contribution Instructions
* Tests
* License
* GitHub Username and URLs

### Built With

This project was built using:

* JavaScript
* [Inquirer.JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone git@github.com:cynthiwu/readme-generator.git 
```

2. Install NPM packages (i.e., Inquirer.js)
```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

It is with this application I hope engineers can spend more time creating something AWESOME, rather than writing a README file. It can be used by anyone who wants to quickly generate a basic README file. The generated file will be created and located in the "created" directory off the root. This file, or just the file content, can be copied over to any given project directory. 

### Demo

Watch the video below to see how the quiz works.

## Roadmap

I will be continuing to build out this project to provide a README template that is usable for all types of projects.
